  Text: "Strolling around the plantation camp, you catch snippets of conversations.
    The workers are discussing the acquisition of tools of war, strategies for uniting
    different factions, and plans to assist and start a revolution. The tension in
    the air is palpable, and you realize you have stumbled upon a valuable piece
    of intelligence.\n\nYou decide to keep the information. You know that by doing
    so, you are aligning yourself with the local resistance\u2014a choice fraught
    with danger but also with the promise of greater respect and trust among the
    people.\n\nJust as you are about to leave, you hear the sound of approaching
    horses and the clatter of boots. Local authorities, alerted by someone\u2026,
    arrive to investigate any potential threats. You make a hasty exit, slipping
    into the shadows to avoid confrontation.\n\nAs you are about to leave the camp
    in a hurry, the weight of your decision heavy on your shoulders, you all have
    gained the trust and respect of the local community, but they must now prepare
    for the inevitable consequences of defying my authority.\n\nNaughty, naughty."
