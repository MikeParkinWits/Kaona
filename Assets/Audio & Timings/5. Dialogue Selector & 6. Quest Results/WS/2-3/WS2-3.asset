  Text: "Sitting under a tree and enjoying the shade in the noon day sun, you see
    a Kanaka wearing a Malo and walking wearily while holding his stomach nearby.
    You decide to investigate.\n\nYawn.\n\nThe man looks up as you approach, shocked
    at the way you are dressed. Barely standing, he struggles to speak as if suffering
    from a tremendous fatigue.\nHow sad\u2026.. maybe he should've educated himself
    and got a job.\n\nYou ask him what\u2019s wrong, and how you may help him.\n\nYou
    won\u2019t be able to help him.\n\nHe says... \"there is not much ferns left
    to eat. \u2026 Governor Boki\u2026 His greed shall be our downfall\u2026 Sandalwood\u2026\"\n\nBuy
    food from a store like a civilized man!\n\nHe falls while the sun is at meridian
    height.\n\nOther Kanaka and Wahine\u2019s rush and approach, although they seem
    to be in a similar state of fatigue.\n\nO Dear, the natives are restless.\n\nThey
    say another dies because of Boki\u2019s greed of sandalwood. He has forced us
    to focus on love for working the land to harvesting and transporting sandalwood
    to pay off debts to westerners\u2026"
