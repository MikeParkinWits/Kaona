  Text: "You find yourself riding alongside lesser ali'i (chiefs) of the Waianae
    Coast on a mission that could change the course of history.\n\nI certainly hope
    not.\n\nThe recent rain has left the air fresh and filled with the scent of flowers.
    As you ride, you see Hawaiians working the land with joy, embodying the spirit
    of 'aina, where work is a form of communion with the land rather than labor.\n\nWhat
    a waste of time.\n\nUpon arriving at the destination\u2014a simple Western-style
    house. How quaint, a Western home... funny how the natives love Western niceties.
    You enter the home.\n\nThe air is filled with the smell of freshly cooked food
    and the sounds of animated conversations. Inside, a gathering of sea captains,
    plantation workers, and traders discuss their plans for a revolution against
    Ka'ahumanu, who has aligned herself with Western advisors pushing Westernization.\n\nA
    Hawaiian woman seems to be leading the conversation. You learn her name to be
    Kuini Liliha.\n\nYou have brought me to her... I thank you.\n\nAs you sit on
    a simple wooden bench, the conversation shifts to the importance of reclaiming
    their cultural heritage and maintaining the community\u2019s values and skills.
    Liliha emphasizes that the tools of war they plan to collect will be vital in
    their fight for independence and cultural preservation. The room falls silent
    as all eyes turn to you, awaiting their decision on whether to support the revolution.\n\nI
    must inform the authorities."
