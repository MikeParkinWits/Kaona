  Text: "Approached by a distressed businessman who informs you of a troubling discovery.
    Julius Lyman Richardson (Pity Lyman was such a good man, smart, sharp, and knew
    the value of the dollar. I admire him dearly), a well-known figure and owner
    of the Big Island Volcano House Hotel, was found dead near the beach, and the
    community believes his death was caused by a curse.\n\nPreposterous, curse\u2026
    really\u2026 I would say a cursor holds more power than a curse.\n\nAlthough
    Richardson\u2019s horse was found nearby and the evidence points to he being
    thrown off his horse. The businessman is convinced there was foul play involved,
    and asks for your investigative assistance.\n\nHe was murdered, not cursed!!"
