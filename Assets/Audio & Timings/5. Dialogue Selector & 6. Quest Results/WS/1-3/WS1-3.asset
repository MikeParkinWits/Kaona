  Text: "You approach two Hawaiians (natives). The first, a robust man with sun-kissed
    skin and strong, calloused hands, wears a simple white cotton shirt tucked into
    faded, knee-length khaki trousers. His feet are bare, hardened by years of working
    the land, and a wide-brimmed straw hat shields his face from the relentless sun.
    His eyes, though tired, reflect a deep determination and connection to his heritage.
    (How primitive)\n\nBeside him is a woman of graceful stature, her dark hair tied
    back in a practical bun. She is dressed in a long, modest dress made of light
    brown linen, the fabric worn but well-kept. Her feet are also bare, and she carries
    a woven basket filled with freshly harvested food. Her face, framed by loose
    tendrils of hair, is etched with the same resolve as the man\u2019s, her gaze
    steady and unyielding.\n\nThey seem to be arguing over something. You approach:\n\nThe
    woman says, \u201CThe Aina of Wai'anae is suffering under the control of James
    Dowsett (what a good man), who hoards precious water for his sugar plantation,
    leaving us with parched fields and dry lo'i. I\u2019m sick of this! We need to
    do something drastic! What should we do?\u201D\n\nDo nothing, I would say\u2026
    or get a job.\n\nThe man looks at you all and asks for assistance in diverting
    water back to the community. How will you help?\n\nSigh."
