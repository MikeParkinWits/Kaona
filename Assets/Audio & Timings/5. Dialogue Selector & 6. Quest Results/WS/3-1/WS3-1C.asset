  Text: "Agreeing with the homesteaders strengthens your bond with the local community,
    but it incurs the Draftsman\u2019s wrath. You must prepare for the repercussions
    of your decision, knowing that you have chosen the path of righteousness.\n\nThe
    world around you begins to shimmer and warp. You suddenly find yourselves standing
    in a glitching office building from 1985. The room is a blend of outdated technology
    and flickering fluorescent lights casting an eerie shadow. Old computer terminals
    with bulky monitors hum softly on metal desks, their screens displaying lines
    of green code interspersed with static. Fax machines whir intermittently, and
    rotary dial phones rest on the desks. The air is filled with the faint scent
    of musty paper and overheated electronics.\n\nAmidst this surreal environment,
    I appear. I am formerly Native Hawaiian with a commanding presence, embodying
    the Western influences I have embraced. My attire is reminiscent of late 19th-century
    Western fashion: a dark suit with a high-collared white shirt, and a neatly tied
    cravat. My well-groomed mustache and hair reflect my meticulous nature. My eyes,
    though still holding a trace of my unfortunate Hawaiian heritage, are hardened
    and cold, indicative of my shift in values.\n\nI gesture around the glitching
    office. \u201CThis is my domain. Everything you see, everything you experience,
    is under my control. You and the natives here are trapped, bound by limitations
    of your outdated ways. Until you embrace the Western way of thinking, abandoning
    your insufficient native traditions, you will remain imprisoned in this existence.
    Land is meant to be owned, controlled, and utilized for progress and profit.\u201D\n\nI
    lean closer, my voice lowering and maintaining its intensity. \u201CYour attempts
    to challenge my authority is futile. But I admire your persistence.\n\nYou attack!
    Summon the Draftsman"
