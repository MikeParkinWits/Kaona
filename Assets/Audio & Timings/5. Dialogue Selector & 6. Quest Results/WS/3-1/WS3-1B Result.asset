  Text: "As you decide to consult with me, the world around you begins to shimmer
    and warp. You suddenly find yourselves standing in a glitching office building
    from 1985. The room is a blend of outdated technology and flickering fluorescent
    lights casting an eerie shadow. Old computer terminals with bulky monitors hum
    softly on metal desks, their screens displaying lines of green code interspersed
    with static. Fax machines whir intermittently, and rotary dial phones rest on
    the desks. The air is filled with the faint scent of musty paper and overheated
    electronics.\n\nAmidst this surreal environment, I appear. I am formerly Native
    Hawaiian with a commanding presence, embodying the Western influences I have
    embraced. My attire is reminiscent of late 19th-century Western fashion: a dark
    suit with a high-collared white shirt, and a neatly tied cravat. My well-groomed
    mustache and hair reflect my meticulous nature. My eyes, though still holding
    a trace of my unfortunate Hawaiian heritage, are hardened and cold, indicative
    of my shift in values.\n\nI gesture around the glitching office. \u201CThis is
    my domain. Everything you see, everything you experience, is under my control.
    You and the natives here are trapped, bound by limitations of your outdated ways.
    Until you embrace the Western way of thinking, abandoning your insufficient native
    traditions, you will remain imprisoned in this existence. Land is meant to be
    owned, controlled, and utilized for progress and profit.\u201D\n\nI lean closer,
    my voice lowering and maintaining its intensity. \u201CYour attempts to challenge
    my authority is futile. But I admire your persistence.\n\nYou attack! Summon
    the Draftsman"
