  Text: "You decide to venture further into the murky depths. The faint glow of the
    coral intensifies, revealing a towering figure standing amidst the labyrinth.
    The being is majestic\u2014a turtle-like entity. Its robes of deep blue flow
    with the currents, adorned with patterns resembling the coral\u2019s shifting
    etchings. In its hand, it holds a staff crowned with an orb radiating a soft
    light, casting rippling reflections across the coral walls.\n\nThe entity gazes
    at you with ancient, knowing eyes. Its voice carries the weight of wisdom and
    reverence:\n\u201CI am Makapo, the guardian of this abyss and steward of thought.
    To seek the pearl is to seek the truths within yourself. But know this: truth
    comes at a price. If you are ready to face the Leviathan of Depths, step forward,
    for the pearl lies within its slumbering maw.\u201D\n\nKeeper Makapo leads you
    deeper into the labyrinth, the coral walls tightening until they give way to
    a vast, open chamber\u2014not separate from the Leviathan, but within it. The
    creature\u2019s immense form coils around the space, its body forming living
    pathways, chambers, and spiraling corridors. Its radiant scales glimmer faintly
    through the inky water, pulsing with ancient memory. At the heart of its slumber
    lies the Pearl of Profound Depths, cradled between massive, unmoving jaws that
    seem both protective and vulnerable.\n\nIn silence, you navigate the winding
    corridors of flesh and thought, each step a test of stillness, each breath a
    measure of your resolve. At last, you reach the pearl.\n\nMakapo approaches wordlessly
    and places the treasure into your hands. It thrums with life\u2014warm and steady.
    Then he turns and vanishes into the dark without a sound. The object in your
    hand begins to vibrate, glowing faintly green.\n\nYou hear it before you see
    it: a low-frequency hum, building like a wave of static. The world around you
    begins to fracture. Geometry overlays reality.\n\nThe ground beneath you ripples
    like liquid code. A digital iris opens\u2014wide and glowing, lined with cascading
    green glyphs.\nThe ground beneath you ripples like liquid code. A digital iris
    opens\u2014wide and glowing, lined with cascading green glyphs."
