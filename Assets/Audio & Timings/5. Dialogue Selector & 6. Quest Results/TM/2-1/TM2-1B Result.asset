    long ago by the will of The Artist. Though I cannot see the world as you do,
    I perceive it through the whispers of thoughts and the ripples of emotion that
    drift through this ocean. My sight is not my own\u2014it belongs to The Artist,
    who shapes this realm with her mind. To see is not to witness the light but to
    feel the truths hidden in the shadows.\u201D\n\nMakapo pauses, gripping his staff
    tightly:\n\u201CIf you seek my aid, you must prove yourselves worthy of my trust.
    Reveal your thoughts to me\u2014your fears, your doubts, and your aspirations.
    Bare them without deceit, for I see through lies as easily as I perceive the
    tides.\u201D"
