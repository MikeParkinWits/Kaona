  Text: "As you navigate the shifting maze of seaweed, glowing symbols of chaos,
    clarity, and balance emerge, illuminating the currents with cryptic guidance.
    The pathways constantly shift, forcing you to interpret the symbols and align
    their meanings to unlock hidden routes and avoid traps. At the maze\u2019s heart,
    the Currents of Wisdom Bracelet rests on a coral pedestal, pulsing with the essence
    of harmony. You solve the puzzle and bring calm to the chaotic waters. Nana\u2019ole
    appears, his voice resonating:\n\u201CYou have proven your understanding of wisdom\u2019s
    flow. You have proven yourself worthy of the wisdom that flows through these
    depths. The Bracelet of Currents is yours\u2014a token of your understanding
    and a guide for the journeys yet to come. Wear it well, for it will remind you
    that wisdom lies not in chaos or clarity alone, but in the harmony between them.\""
