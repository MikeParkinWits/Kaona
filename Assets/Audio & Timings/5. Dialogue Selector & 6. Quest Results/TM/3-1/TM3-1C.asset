  Text: "As you demand that the Artist restore the realm to its former glory, her
    form twists violently, fragments of her body spiraling outward like shattered
    glass caught in an unseen storm. Her voice erupts in a discordant wail, layering
    screams with guttural whispers:\n\n\u201CRestore it? RESTORE IT? You think I
    control this?! Do you see the truth that claws at the edges of your mind? The
    realm was never whole! It was an illusion\u2014a lie painted over an abyss that
    was always there, waiting to devour me\u2014and now, you!\u201D\n\nHer laughter
    cracks the air like thunder, breaking into words that bleed malice:\n\n\u201CYou
    think you can demand of me? I am not the Artist\u2014I am her ruin! Her mind
    is a thousand pieces, and now you will feel every one!\u201D\n\nBefore you react,
    she surges forward, her essence dissolving into a torrent of blackened light
    that tears into your thoughts. For a fleeting moment, the world around you disappears,
    replaced by a void of writhing shadows\u2014each one a fragment of her broken
    mind. The whispers grow deafening, each competing for dominance, filling your
    thoughts with incoherent babble and visions of unraveling realities.\n\nYour
    sense of self splinters, and the weight of her madness presses against you like
    an unstoppable tide.\n\n\u201CDo you see it now?\u201D her voice whispers\u2014softer
    now, but infinitely more sinister\u2014resonating from within your own thoughts.\n\u201CThere
    is no balance, no peace\u2014only this! And now, it is yours too!\u201D\n\nThe
    connection snaps violently, and you are thrown from the abyss, gasping as the
    realm around you reforms\u2014but it is no longer the same. The Artist is gone,
    her fractured essence scattered into the waters.\n\nYou awaken in another Moku,
    your mind raw and reeling, echoes of her madness still clawing at the edge of
    your thoughts. The realm around you is alien and unfamiliar\u2014a new piece
    of the fractured Moku\u2014and the weight of your failure lingers heavy around
    you."
