  Text: "You turn to the Artist, her fragmented form flickering in and out of focus\u2014a
    twisting mix of light and shadow.\n\n\u201CWhat happened here?\u201D you ask,
    your voice trembling against the oppressive weight of her presence.\n\nFor a
    moment, she is silent. Then her laughter erupts\u2014a shrill, broken cacophony
    that echoes endlessly, weaving into itself like a maddening spiral.\n\n\u201CWhat
    happened? What didn\u2019t happen?\u201D she shrieks, her voice splintering into
    whispers and howls.\n\n\u201CThe harmony you saw? It was a lie! A fragile, trembling
    thing that could not hold! The Leviathans fell, the spells unraveled, the palaces
    cracked\u2014and it was me, it was me, it was always me!\u201D\n\nHer form splinters
    further, the air filled with the stench of salt and decay as she wails:\n\n\u201CDo
    you see it now? The depths of what I have become? There is no surface, no depth\u2014only
    the churning, endless chaos of a mind that cannot rest!\u201D\n\nHer words dissolve
    into incoherent mutterings, leaving the water around you vibrating with their
    impossible weight."
