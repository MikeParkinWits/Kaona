  Text: "The currents guide you into a chamber of impossible geometry, where coral
    structures twist in directions that defy logic and perspective. Strange symbols
    pulse with otherworldly light, appearing in places that seem to shift when not
    directly observed. The water here hums with an unsettling vibration that fills
    your mind with whispers that are not your own.\n\nAs you move through the maze,
    strange visions close in. Shadows twist and shift, and voices rise from the dark,
    accusing and screaming. Your very being is filled with fear.\nYou must trust
    your instincts. You close your eyes and lean into your instincts.\n\nYou open
    your eyes at the center of it all and find the Anemone Crown of Intuition, floating
    on a still column of currents. When you take it, the chaos fades, replaced by
    a deep, quiet voice:\n\u201CYou have walked the edge of madness and emerged with
    your mind intact. This crown is yours\u2014a token of intuition\u2019s triumph
    over fear.\u201D"
