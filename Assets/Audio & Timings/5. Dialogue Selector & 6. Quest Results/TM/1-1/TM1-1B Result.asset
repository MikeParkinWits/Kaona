  Text: "Choosing to observe the figure from a distance, you watch the turtle's every
    move with keen interest, seeking to understand the purpose behind its seemingly
    aimless wandering. As you watch, you begin to notice a subtle pattern in the
    turtle's movements. It's not random at all; instead, there's a rhythm\u2014a
    sequence that mirrors the ebb and flow of the waves around the floating island."
