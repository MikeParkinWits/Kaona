  Text: "With the Blade of Balance in hand, you step toward the swirling shards of
    the shattered mirror, its jagged pieces glowing faintly with shifting images
    of your past and subconscious. As the blade hums with a serene, steady energy,
    you begin to draw the fragments together, each movement guided by intuition rather
    than force. The shards resist at first, their surfaces emanating bursts of light
    and shadow, conjuring spectral guardians\u2014manifestations of fears, doubts,
    and hidden truths\u2014that lash out in defense. With each precise strike of
    the Blade, you dispel the illusions, cutting through the chaos with clarity and
    purpose. Gradually, the shards align, fusing into a single, brilliant surface
    that reflects not just your form but the unity of this Moku."
