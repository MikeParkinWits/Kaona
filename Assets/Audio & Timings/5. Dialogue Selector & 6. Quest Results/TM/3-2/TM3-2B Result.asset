  Text: "Without the Blade, you attempt to approach the Artist with empathy, stepping
    cautiously into the swirling chaos that surrounds her. Her fragmented form trembles,
    her voice an anguished chorus of contradiction:\n\n\u201CYou seek to understand
    this? To know me? You think you can shift through the currents, through the screams,
    through the silence? My mind is this ocean! It is endless! It will drown you!\u201D\n\nThe
    chaotic waters calm slightly, and the Artist\u2019s form flickers with a fleeting
    moment of clarity. Her voice trembles, quieter now:\n\n\u201CYou have glimpsed
    it\u2026 the storm within. It cannot be mended, but you\u2026 you bring a light
    to the depths. Perhaps it is enough.\u201D"
