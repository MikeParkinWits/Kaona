  Text: "As you wield the Blade of Balance, its coral structure hums softly, resonating
    with the chaotic currents of the Artist\u2019s mind. The swirling void around
    you reacts to its presence\u2014the chaotic thoughts and currents calming slightly
    as you step closer to the fractured figure of the Artist. Her form flickers,
    torn between radiant light and suffocating shadow, her voice a blend of broken
    laughter and quiet sobs:\n\n\u201CYou bring balance here? To me? Do you think
    the Blade will calm this storm? You cannot separate the surface from the depths\u2026
    but try, seeker. Try!\u201D\n\nThe Blade glows brighter, stabilizing the chaotic
    waters momentarily. The Artist\u2019s voice softens, though still fractured:\n\n\u201CYou\u2026
    you carry harmony where I could not. The storm quiets, but it will never be still.
    Go forward, seeker, and hold to that balance.\u201D\n\nYou leave with a sense
    of clarity, gaining insights into the fractured realm and the Artist\u2019s plight."
