  Text: "The Havenback stretches endlessly across the horizon, a leviathan whose
    immense, motionless form floats gently upon the ocean\u2019s surface. Its back
    is a breathtaking reef of crystalline coral, glowing softly with hues of aquamarine,
    violet, and gold, refracting the sunlight into shifting rainbows across the water.
    Towering coral spires rise like ancient monuments, their jagged peaks crowned
    by glowing trees whose roots twist deep into the living reef, intertwining with
    its veins. Pools of shimmering water dot the coral expanse, teeming with bioluminescent
    life, while the Havenback\u2019s massive body lies still, as if it has forgotten
    the tides and the freedom of the depths it once embraced.\n\nAt the summit of
    a coral spire, the Turtle Elder stands tall, his ceremonial robes of gold and
    blue rippling faintly in the ocean breeze. A crystalline staff crowned with a
    softly glowing orb rests in his hand, and the runes etched into his shell shimmer
    faintly with an inner light. His deep, resonant voice carries across the stillness:\n\n\u201CTravelers,
    you walk upon the sacred being\u2014one who once bridged the surface and the
    depths. This Havenback, like the Artist, has forgotten the harmony it once upheld.
    You seek the Artist, but know this\u2014her mind is the ocean itself. To enter
    it is to step into the chaos of unbound thoughts, where the currents will twist
    your own until you no longer know them.\u201D\n\nAs he finishes, a deep tremor
    shakes the Havenback, the coral spires flickering as a mournful groan echoes
    through the air. Suddenly, the light vanishes, and the ocean twists violently
    around you. The Elder\u2019s form dissolves into mist as the vortex of blackened
    water pulls you down into an endless abyss, his final words echoing faintly:\n\n\u201CThe
    currents have claimed you\u2026 tread carefully, for they carry not only the
    Artist\u2019s thoughts, but your own.\u201D\n\nAmidst the chaos, a fragmented
    form appears before you\u2026"
