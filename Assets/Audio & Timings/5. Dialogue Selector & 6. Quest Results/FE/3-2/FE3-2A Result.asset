  Text: 'As you delve into the mysteries of the ancient ruins, the sound of an approaching
    group catches your attention. Choosing transparency, you decide to meet these
    newcomers. To your surprise, the group resembles the warriors you have encountered
    before, with the same style of rugged, stone and metal-based armor, but with
    an added feature: large metal cages affixed to their backs, evidently for carrying
    salvaged items.


    These salvagers, their attire blending the warrior''s traditional
    garb with the practicalities of their trade, have an air of resilience about
    them. They greet you all with a mix of wariness and intrigue. During your conversation,
    the salvagers reveal that these ruins, one of three such ancient sites, have
    been a constant presence in the realm, existing long before their own time. They
    explain their purpose here: to recover material to be used to craft armaments
    for their war against the sentinels.


    The leader of the salvagers, his armor
    adorned with subtle markings of his past exploits, extends an offer to you. He
    suggests that if you help with the salvage operation, you would be rewarded with
    a share of the findings. You agree and are rewarded.'
