  Text: 'You see in the distance what appears to be an ancient ruin. You decide to
    approach. As you approach the site of the ancient ruins, you are greeted by a
    landscape of stone structures, their forms worn and fragmented by time. This
    cityscape, scattered across the area, hint at a grandeur long lost, their purpose
    obscured by the passage of centuries. The shapes are peculiar, some tall and
    slender, others broad and curved, evoking a sense of order and design that is
    now but a whisper of the past.


    Among the weathered stone, glints of metal
    catch your eye. These metallic fragments, interspersed throughout the wreckage,
    bear the marks of intricate workmanship. Their tarnished surfaces are adorned
    with patterns and engravings, suggesting a functionality that is no longer discernible.
    The metal pieces vary in size and shape; some are small and delicate, resembling
    the components of a complex mechanism, while others are larger, with smooth,
    curved forms that hint at mobility and transport.


    The entire scene paints
    a picture of a civilization that once thrived, blending stone and metal in ways
    that now defy clear understanding. You can''t help but feel a sense of mystery
    and intrigue as you explore this forgotten place, where the lines between natural
    formations and crafted structures are blurred, and the remnants of a bygone era
    lay silent, holding their secrets close.


    You hear a group approaching from
    behind you.'
