  Text: "Concealed within the ruins, you watch as the group of salvagers busily works
    among the ancient structures. You observe closely as these individuals, clad
    in armor resembling the metallic pieces they collect, carefully extract chunks
    of metal from the surroundings. These metals, bearing a striking similarity to
    the material of the salvagers' own armor, are methodically assessed and then
    secured into the large cages on their backs.\n\nThe salvagers move with a sense
    of purpose, their actions a blend of respect for the materials and the practical
    task at hand. You notice the familiarity in the salvagers' handling of the metal,
    suggesting a deep connection and understanding of its properties and potential
    uses. The sound of metal being gathered and stored echoes softly throughout the
    ruins, a subtle reminder of the ongoing cycle of use and reuse that has pervaded
    this realm for generations.\n\nFrom your hidden position, you gain insight into
    the salvagers' role in the realm's ecosystem\u2014not just as warriors, but as
    custodians of a legacy embedded in the very metal they harvest and wear. This
    quiet observation sheds light on the continuity of tradition and the practical
    realities of survival in a land where the past is intricately woven into the
    present."
