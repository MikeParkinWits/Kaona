  Text: "The chanting continues for a time, then stops abruptly as one of the warriors
    notices your approach. In the cold, dark stillness, you announce who you are.
    The two warriors remain silent, while the chanter speaks. Their voice is rich
    and resonant, carrying the weight of history, shifting seamlessly between male
    and female tones. \u201CBeware the Sentinels,\u201D they say, their words layered
    with ancient sorrow. \u201CThose silent towers that loom over our land. To us,
    they are cruel oppressors, against whom we have waged a ceaseless war.\u201D
    Their voice, both commanding and soft, echoes with the pain of their people\u2019s
    enduring struggle, a plea for you to grasp the complexity of the conflict. \u201CYou
    tread upon a land scarred by battle,\u201D they continue, \u201Cwhere every stone
    tells a story of defiance against what we perceive as tyranny. Be cautious, be
    wise, and see beyond the silence of these monoliths to the deeper truths of our
    struggle.\u201D Their warning, filled with emotion, serves as a powerful reminder
    of the relentless war and a call for empathy and understanding as you journey
    through this troubled land."
