  Text: "In the dim glow of the cold lava rivers, a lone chanter stands solemnly,
    their presence radiating a deep, sorrowful aura. The figure is a being of both
    male and female essence, shifting subtly between the two, embodying both the
    reverence of a guardian and the melancholy of a mourner. Their eyes are closed
    in silent prayer, neither voice nor body confined by a single form.\n\nAs the
    chant begins, the voice resonates with a haunting and powerful timbre, a sound
    both rich and sorrowful. Each note carries the weight of grief, vibrating with
    an intensity that weaves a tapestry of raw emotion. The rhythm mirrors the tremors
    of the earth\u2014primal and fierce, yet infused with a delicate sorrow, as if
    each word is a tear for the lives lost to time.\n\nBeside the chanter, two composed
    warriors stand, their forms towering even in the dim light. Clad in ancient armaments
    forged from stone and metal, they are a living example of the enduring craftsmanship
    of their people. Their stone armor, dark and rugged, clings to them like a second
    skin, shaped by centuries of tradition and conflict. Intricate cultural arcane
    symbols, etched into the stone, glow faintly with an otherworldly light.\n\nAt
    their feet lies a shadow, motionless. Though it is but an outline in the dim
    light, you can only imagine it to be the fallen body of a warrior, one whose
    fate is now woven into the chant\u2019s lament."
