  Text: In a moment tinged with sorrow and desperation, you find yourself urging
    the severely injured warriors to return to battle against the Sentinel towers.
    Despite the warriors' blistered skin and the pain etched on their faces, their
    resolve is reignited by your persuasion. As they turn back towards the looming
    towers, there's a tragic bravery in their steps, a poignant acceptance of their
    fate. Their silhouettes, marred by injuries and smoke, become a heart-wrenching
    symbol of the sacrifice as they disappear into the battlefield. You are left
    with a profound sense of sadness, knowing that these warriors, driven by a sense
    of duty and belief, are walking towards an almost certain demise. The air is
    heavy with the weight of this decision, a somber reminder of the cost of war
    and the price of unwavering conviction in a cause.
