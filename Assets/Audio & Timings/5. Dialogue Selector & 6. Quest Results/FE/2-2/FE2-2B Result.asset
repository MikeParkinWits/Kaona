  Text: In the midst of chaos and suffering, you create a small sanctuary of solace
    and peace for the injured warriors. You find a quiet spot away from the turmoil,
    where the distant glow of the lava rivers casts a gentle light. Here, you carefully
    tend to the warriors' wounds, your actions gentle and deliberate. You share words
    of comfort, your voice soft and empathetic, cutting through the pain and fear.
    For a brief moment, the warriors are allowed to lay down their burdens, their
    blistered skin and pained expressions easing under the care. In this temporary
    haven, there's a sense of shared humanity, a poignant pause in the relentless
    cycle of conflict. Your compassion provides a fleeting, yet powerful respite,
    offering the warriors a rare moment of peace amidst the ravages of their unyielding
    war.
