  Text: 'Approaching the Sentinel towers, you navigate through a warm, misty haze,
    easily stepping around the steamy currents. As you draw near, the towers reveal
    themselves to be just massive structures of stone and granite, with steam vents
    dotting their surfaces. This simple yet striking realization dawns on you: the
    towers are not sentient beings, but natural formations, their intimidating aura
    a result of misinterpreted geological activity. This discovery underscores the
    futility of the warriors'' conflict, a war waged against mere inanimate objects,
    fueled by deep-seated but misplaced emotions and beliefs.


    You find a small
    fragment of a stone; you decide to keep it as a reminder of the futility of war.
    The stone in your hand pulses. Terminal code flickers in your vision.'
