  Text: "Driven by necessity but mindful of the sacred, you carefully search the
    encampment for essential supplies without disturbing the sanctity of the rites.\n\nAs
    you search through the equipment and supplies, one thing stands out: stone armor
    adorning each figure, intricately etched with symbols of cultural significance.
    Despite its sturdiness, the armor seems to cradle the bodies in a protective
    embrace, and notably, no weapons are found\u2014a choice perhaps signifying a
    desire for these warriors to rest unburdened by the tools of war. Instead, small
    personal or practical items are found, such as trinkets and amulets made of stone.
    You decide to keep one of these talismans, as it may aid you in your journey."
