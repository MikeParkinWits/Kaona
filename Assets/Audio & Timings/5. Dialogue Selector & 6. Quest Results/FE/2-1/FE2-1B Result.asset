  Text: "In their strategic assault, you join the warriors, using the weapons to
    target the Sentinel towers. They coordinate their attacks with precision, aiming
    to create a significant impact. However, as the battle progresses, it becomes
    clear that their efforts are in vain \u2014 the towers remain utterly unaffected.
    This stark realization hits them hard, underscoring the futility of attacking
    an inanimate object and pointing to the need for addressing the real emotional
    struggles within."
