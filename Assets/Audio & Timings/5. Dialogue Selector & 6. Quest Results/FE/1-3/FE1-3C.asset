  Text: You solemnly escort the survivor across the rugged granite terrain. The journey
    is marked by a silent camaraderie and a shared determination to reach safety.
    Despite your efforts, the survivor's condition deteriorates steadily, their injuries
    too severe to withstand the arduous journey. In the fading light of the cold
    lava rivers, their last breath was given, leaving you in a poignant moment of
    grief and helplessness. The realization that they will never make it to see kin
    again weighs heavily on your heart, underscoring the brutal reality of the realm's
    unending conflict and the fragile nature of life amidst such turmoil. This solemn
    trek, ending in unforeseen tragedy, becomes a profound testament to the cost
    of war and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of insurmountable odds.
