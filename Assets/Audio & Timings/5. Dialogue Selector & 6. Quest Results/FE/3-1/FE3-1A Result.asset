  Text: "You cautiously venture into the depths of the Whispering Cavern, your steps
    echoing softly on the smooth stone floor. The air around you vibrates with a
    subtle, almost mystical energy, as if the very essence of the cavern is alive
    with ancient secrets. Guided by your keen senses and an innate curiosity, you
    navigate through the labyrinthine passages, your ears tuned to the cavern\u2019s
    unique acoustic phenomena.\n\nAs you delve deeper, the cavern reveals its extraordinary
    nature. The cavern seems to echo not only voices but your very thoughts. Their
    emanations resonate and amplify in a way that seems to mirror your emotional
    state.\n\nYou begin to understand that the cavern not only magnifies sound but
    also reflects the underlying emotions and truths of those within it.\n\nIn a
    secluded chamber at the heart of the cavern, you find walls adorned with intricate,
    ancient carvings illuminated by the frost-blue flames that etch the very landscape
    of this Moku. The carvings are a tapestry of countless battles against the Sentinels\u2014a
    story of the futility of unchecked emotions. You also see chipped pieces missing
    from this mural, as if someone has removed pieces of this diorama.\n\nSuddenly,
    the cavern begins to hum with a loud sound. A small, hand-sized fragment of the
    mural breaks away and hovers to your chest. It burns a small hole in whatever
    you are wearing and attaches itself to the flesh above your heart.\n\nYou are
    filled with emotion. Fever. You try and claw and remove the stone from your body,
    but you seem to be missing something required.\n\nYour eyes widen, your breath
    is labored, and your vision is clear. Destroy the Sentinels."
