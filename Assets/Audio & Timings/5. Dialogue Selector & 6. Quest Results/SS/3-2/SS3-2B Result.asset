  Text: "Utilizing resources at hand, you set about constructing artificial reefs
    from the scattered debris and plant life adrift in the sky, providing much-needed
    habitats for the dwindling fish populations. These makeshift sanctuaries, though
    effective in the short term, bloom with life, drawing schools of fish back to
    their swirling waters. However, this solution serves merely as a bandage\u2014a
    temporary reprieve that underscores the necessity of finding a more profound,
    lasting method to restore the natural balance and harmony of the sky's fragmented
    oceans."
