  Text: In a quiet forest clearing, surrounded by towering trees, you come across
    the scattered remnants of a nearly forgotten craft. Branches of koa wood, both
    strong and pliable, lie among the leaves, waiting to be shaped into an 'ukeke.
    With care, you select one piece, running your hand over its smooth grain, feeling
    the instrument hidden within it. Sunlight filters gently through the canopy as
    you gather fiber from coconut husks nearby, preparing the strings that will one
    day carry its voice. Working alongside the Kanaka, you carve the wood and smooth
    its edges with a practiced touch, each movement steeped in tradition. When the
    strings are finally stretched into place, the Kanaka lifts the 'ukeke and plays
    a gentle tune, the melody weaving through the trees like a breath from the past.
    In gratitude, he offers the instrument to you, passing on the stories and spirit
    it holds.
