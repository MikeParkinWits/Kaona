  Text: "You attempt to rush the process\u2026 In your eagerness to assist, you misinterpret
    the guidance of the forest spirits, taking actions that inadvertently hinder
    the Kanaka\u2019s efforts rather than help. Your missteps deepen the rift between
    the Kanaka and their craft, casting a heavier shadow of sorrow over the clearing.
    The once-vibrant trees and plants seem to withdraw, their energy fading as the
    air grows still. You are left with a stark reminder of the consequences of acting
    without truly listening and understanding, the harmony of the land now dimmed
    by your error."
