  Text: "You have been traversing a floating plateau for some time, moving with cautious
    grace through the ethereal landscape adrift in the clouds. The ground beneath
    you is a patchwork of contrasts\u2014vibrant greenery bursts forth in lush pockets,
    a forest in the sky where trees and plants thrive in splendid isolation. The
    air is crisp, tinged with the scent of flowers and the earthy musk of moss-covered
    stones. Sunlight filters through the leafy canopy above, casting dappled patterns
    on the ground. Yet, this beauty is marred by the Shattering; gaps yawn between
    patches of this floating oasis, requiring you to leap with precision from one
    verdant island to the next. With each jump, your heart races over the void, propelled
    by the promise of discovery.\n\nIn a quiet clearing, you spot a Kanaka\u2014solid
    yet fragmented.\n\nAmidst the remnants of a world torn asunder, this figure attempts
    the ancient art of crafting an 'ukeke, a task once woven harmoniously into daily
    life. They, too, bear the marks of the Shattering\u2014not only in the fractured
    land but within their very being. Their hands, once nimble, now appear bulky
    and disjointed, stony fingers struggling to carve the instrument with delicate
    precision. Parts of their body float close but separate, held together by an
    unseen force, mirroring the fractured world they inhabit.\n\nEach attempt to
    shape the 'ukeke ends in frustration, the chisel awkward in their stone grip,
    their once-fluid motions now jagged and strained. A discordant energy fills the
    air, a reflection of the lost connection to their craft. Around them, trees and
    plants stand as silent witnesses to this struggle, their leaves whispering of
    a time before the world was broken. The unfinished 'ukeke, lying imperfectly
    in their lap, becomes a symbol of a realm and a people yearning to restore harmony
    amidst the chaos."
