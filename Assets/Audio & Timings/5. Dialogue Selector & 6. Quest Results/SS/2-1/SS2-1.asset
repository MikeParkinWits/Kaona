  Text: "It\u2019s been some time, drifting among the clouds. Suddenly, a plateau
    emerges into view. In the center of this floating landmass lies a Lo\u2018i.
    You decide to ascend and investigate.\nYou land in the Lo\u2018i, and your heart
    fills with sorrow. The Lo\u2018i around you is not a vibrant green but a sickly
    grey. The water beneath your feet is thick, viscous, and as dark as black smoke.
    Suddenly, a rock formation stirs\u2014a Kanaka. Its head, limbs, and entire form
    are composed of fragmented rock, suspended in place. It speaks in a language
    you somehow understand.\n\nHe says,\n\n\u201CAloha,\n\nThe Lo\u2018i is more
    than just a plot of land; it is a living, breathing entity that nurtures not
    only the taro but the spirit of the community. It serves as a reminder of our
    interconnectedness with the world around us, a call to preserve and cherish the
    natural gifts bestowed upon us, and to tread gently on this earth, which we share
    with countless beings. Through the Lo\u2018i, we learn patience, perseverance,
    and the profound impact of working in harmony with nature\u2019s cycles, ensuring
    that the land we borrow from our ancestors is passed down, fertile and abundant,
    to our descendants\u2014a testament to our respect and care for this shared home.\n\nThis
    was before the Shattering. Now, this place, once the heart of the \u2019Aina,
    is all that remains, soon to vanish. All that holds this shell of the Lo\u2018i
    is the fading light of my soul. I was once its Mahi'ai, and in a way, I still
    am\u2026 Yet I fear it won\u2019t be long before my inner light fades completely.\u201D\n\nYou
    are overwhelmed by a sense of loss for a memory you never had."
