  Text: "You are guided by the whispers of the ocean\u2014voices that carry the ancient
    wisdom of the Coral Guardians. You dive into the heart of the troubled waters,
    where the once-thriving coral reefs lay in silent despair. You collect samples
    of the afflicted corals and create a healing salve from rare algae and sea minerals,
    and perform a purification ritual at the reef's core, all under the watchful
    gaze of the ocean's depths.\n\nAs you work, you weave through the coral structures
    with care, applying the salve to the corals, which begin to pulse with a faint,
    returning vibrancy. They chant the old melodies of the sea, a harmonious plea
    for renewal that resonates through the water, enveloping the reef in a gentle,
    glowing aura. The ritual\u2014a blend of emotion, spirit, and mind\u2014slowly
    lifts the blight, revealing the true colors of the coral beneath.\n\nIn recognition
    of your efforts, the Coral Guardians, through voices that ripple across the water's
    surface, express their deep gratitude. From the very essence of the rejuvenated
    reef, they sculpt The Tide Breaker, a Mano of coral and light. This majestic
    creature, embodying the strength and beauty of the healed reef, swims loyally
    by your side. The Tide Breaker, with its body aglow with the vibrant colors of
    a healthy reef, serves as a symbol of the restored harmony between humanity and
    the natural world, and a reminder of the profound impact of compassionate action."
